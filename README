The slp_sm (sparse linear prediction with splitting methods) solves 
the sparse linear prediction problem 

   minimize   ||x-Xa||_1 + gamma ||a||_1
      a

where X is a convolution matrix formed from the signal x. 

The considered methods for solving the above problem are
  1: Douglas-Rachford (DR)
  2: Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)

Provided is both a Matlab and a C++ implementation.
    mlib/utilities: Matlab implementation
    src: C++ implementation

This software is used in the paper

   Fast Algorithms for High-Order Sparse Linear Prediction
   with Applications to Speech Processing

   Please give reference if you use this software.


= MATLAB:
=========

To use the matlab implementation, it is necessary to compile two c-files. To do 
this first run "make" in the root directory of this software. If you do not have a c-compiler, follow the instructions on the screen.

Then add /mlib and /utilities to your path.

An example of usage is given in /example/example_dr_admm_slp.m

Location:
   /mlib and /utilities

Requirements:
    + A c-compiler

The following libraries are necessary for running the tests:

  - mlib/test.m and utilities/test.m
    + Matlabs unittest framework. Available from release 2013a 
    + cvx: http://cvxr.com/cvx/


= C++ implementation:
=====================

Location:
   /src

The following libraries are are necessary for running the programs:
    + fftw3 library (fftw.org)
    + BLAS and LAPACK libraries
    / optional Math Kernel Library (MKL)


The following libraries are necessary for running the tests in src/unittest:
    + Googletest,  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/
    + fftw3 library (fftw.org)
    + BLAS and LAPACK libraries
    / optional Math Kernel Library (MKL)

The C++ source code is implemented to benefit from Math Kernel Library
If you want to make use of this, compile with -DMKL and add the necessary
libraries to the link command. Otherwise, a link command along the lines 
-lblas -llapack -lfftw3 -lfftw3f should do. See src/Makefile
